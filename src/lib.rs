/// Automate starting, ending, protecting and barriering for read phase.

/// **In read phase, programmers must aware following restrictions.**
///
/// 1. Reading global variables is permitted and reading shared
///    records is permitted if pointers to them were obtained
///    during this phase.
///   - e.g., by traversing a sequence of shared objects by
///     following pointers starting from a global variableâ€”i.e., a root
///
/// 2. Writes/CASs to shared records, writes/CASs to shared globals,
///    and system calls, are **not permitted.**
///
/// To understand the latter restriction, suppose an operation
/// allocates a node using malloc during its read phase, and before
/// it uses the node, the thread performing the operation is
/// neutralized. This would cause **a memory leak.**
///
/// Additionally, writes to thread local data structures are
/// not recommended. To see why, suppose a thread maintains
/// a thread local doubly-linked list, and also updates this list
/// as part of the read phase of some operation on the shared data
/// structure. If the thread is neutralized in middle of its update
/// to this local list, it might corrupt the structure of the list.
///
/// # Usage

///
/// # HACK: "Why a dummy loop with `black_box` is used?"
///
/// It is not needed in normal builds, but
/// when address-sanitizing, the address sanitizer often gives
/// a false positive by recognizing `longjmp` as
/// stack buffer overflow (or stack corruption).
///
/// However, awkwardly, if it wrapped by a loop block,
/// it seems that the sanitizer recognizes `longjmp` as
/// normal `continue` operation and totally satisfies with it.
///
/// So, they are added to avoid false positives from the sanitizer.
